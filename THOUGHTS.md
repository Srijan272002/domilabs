So here's my idea for Real-Time Ship Sensor Data
- We can connect sensors to the internet probably or can we can upload the data locally when we get the signal.
- We can setup a computer inside the ship which will collect data through sensors then we will send that data to servers
- We can make a cloud server for it to make sure the data is updated time to time which can help us in real time monitoring and ai predictions
- Once the data is in cloud storage we can visualize and analyze data with the help of dashboards there we can easily train ai models to predict problems 
To handle route planning with dynamic weather updates
1) We can setup a weather monitoring network
- satellites wathcing weather patterns
- other ships sharing what weather they are expecting 
2) AI should think like a captian ( probably brain of Captain Jack Sparrow)
3) Just like google maps it should also show diffrents routes (shortest, slightly longer, emergency route)
