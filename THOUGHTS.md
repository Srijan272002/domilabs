So here's my idea for Real-Time Ship Sensor Data
- We can connect sensors to the internet probably or can we can upload the data locally when we get the signal.
- We can setup a computer inside the ship which will collect data through sensors then we will send that data to servers
- We can make a cloud server for it to make sure the data is updated time to time which can help us in real time monitoring and ai predictions
- Once the data is in cloud storage we can visualize and analyze data with the help of dashboards there we can easily train ai models to predict problems
